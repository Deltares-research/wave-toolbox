The Deltares Wave Toolbox package is made to handle data from wave gauges, measuring the water level elevation during physical model experiments featuring free surface waves. The package supports analyses in both time (using the Series and WaveHeights classes) and spectral (using the Spectrum class) domains. Common analyses available in the package include among others: zero-crossing analysis, wave height exceedance curves, converting water level elevation time series to variance density spectrum and vice versa, spectral wave parameters, theoretical spectra and wave height exceedance curves.
